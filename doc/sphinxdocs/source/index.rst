Fortran for Speed, Python for Comfort

Fwrap wraps Fortran code in C, Cython and Python.  It focuses on Fortran 90 and
95, and will work with Fortran 77 so long as you limit yourself to "sane"
Fortran 77. [#sane-def]_ 

Fwrap is licensed under the new BSD license.

Fwrap is in beta-stage until otherwise indicated.  All commandline options and
public APIs are subject to change.

Fwrap changed its SCM from Mercurial to Git (github with a mirror on
sourceforge).  You can access the main development repository 
`here on github <http://github.com/fwrap/fwrap>`_.

Documentation
=============

these documents mostly serve as a place to dump notes
while developing.

`The tutorial <doc/tutorial.html>`_ covers the basics of generating
Python wrappers for Fortran code for various use cases.

.. [#sane-def]
   By "sane", we mean don't use `ENTRY`, `EQUIVALENCE`, STATEMENT functions, or
   other dark corners of Fortran 77.  If you don't know what these are, count
   yourself lucky.
